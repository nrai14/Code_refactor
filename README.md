# Code Refactor Challenge 

## HTML CSS Git Code Refactor 

For this project, we were given a codebase for an SEO company that required refining. The company (our client) had two aims: 1) A code base that follows accesssbility standards 2) A site taht is optimised for search engines. Thus, for this task, we analysed manners in which to improve the quality of the codebase by making it "cleaner". 

The first part of this project was cloning the starter code locally as well as creating a GitHub repository. A vital step for each project, as this allowed myself to share work with others who could review/collaborate with me. The repository link is as follows: 

The following are the changes that were made to ensure that the codebase matched the acceptance criteria:

* Updated the majority of "div" tags for more descriptive elements (e.g. nav, aside etc)
* Updated respective CSS stylesheet elements as a result of the previous 
* Updated website title to "Horiseon | SEO | Homepage"
* Added alt attributes to all images to follow accessibility best practices - images described clearly with context 
* Updated "benefits" class to avoid some repeitition 
* Updated h elements to fall in sequential order 
* Added some commentary to both HTML and CSS files to checkpoint each of their reflective purposes within the codebase

Reviewing the project, it demonstrated the key importance of having an eye for detail to ensure proper coding practice is implemented at all times. There are always opportunities available to analyse and present cleaner code, which in turn feeds into honing my own abilities to build websites from scratch.
